## The "Strawman" Theory

The "Strawman" theory is a belief that when a child is born in the United States, a separate legal entity, or "strawman," is created by the government. This "strawman" is a legal fiction that is used by the government and financial institutions to control and tax the individual.

According to this theory, the "strawman" is represented by the name on your birth certificate, driver's license, and other legal documents, which is typically written in all capital letters (e.g., JOHN DOE).

The flesh-and-blood individual (e.g., John Doe) is seen as the rightful owner of the "strawman," and has the power to "redeem" or take control of the "strawman" and its assets.

## Asserting Sovereignty

Proponents of these theories believe that by separating themselves from their "strawman," they can declare themselves "sovereign" and exempt from most government laws, taxes, and legal proceedings.

Some common methods and phrases used to assert sovereignty include:

*   **Refusing to identify oneself to law enforcement:** Instead of providing a driver's license or other identification, a person may state that they are "traveling" and not "driving," and therefore not subject to traffic laws.
*   **Using specific legal phrases:** Proponents of these theories often use specific legal-sounding phrases in an attempt to challenge the jurisdiction of a court or to avoid a legal obligation. For example, they may say "I do not consent to these proceedings."
*   **Filing UCC-1 financing statements:** Some individuals file UCC-1 financing statements in an attempt to claim ownership of their "strawman" and its assets.
