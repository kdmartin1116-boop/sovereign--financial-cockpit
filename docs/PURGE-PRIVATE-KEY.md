## History rewrite: removed `config/private_key.pem`

What I did:

- Created a backup branch `backup/private-key-before-purge` and pushed it to origin.
- Used `git-filter-repo` to remove the file `config/private_key.pem` from all commits in repository history.
- Restored the `origin` remote and force-pushed the rewritten `main` branch.

Important follow-ups for the team:

1. Rotate the compromised private key immediately. Do not reuse it.
2. Update any services, CI, or servers that used the key.
3. Inform collaborators; they should reclone the repository or reset their `main` branch:

3. Inform collaborators; they should reclone the repository or reset their `main` branch:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git reset --hard origin/main
```

Notes:
- The backup branch `backup/private-key-before-purge` contains the pre-rewrite history and is available on origin if needed.
- If you need a full removal from all mirrors or caches, follow provider-specific guidance.

Scan of repository history (high level):

- I ran an additional history scan across all git blobs for PEM headers, API-key-like tokens, and high-entropy base64-like strings.
- Findings of note:
	- A Google-style API key-like string was found in a blob (starts with `AIza...`). If this is a real key, rotate it immediately.
	- Several blobs contained long legal/templated text (likely harmless application text), flagged only because they contain the word "private" or are long.
	- The private key `config/private_key.pem` was present in history (now removed) and remains on disk in the working directory; delete it and rotate.

Suggested next steps:

1. Rotate any keys mentioned above (Google API key, and the OpenSSH private key).
2. If needed, run a deeper provider-specific purge or contact providers to remove cached copies.
3. Communicate to collaborators and update CI secrets.
